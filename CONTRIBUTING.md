## Code Style

- We use Black for code formatting
- Ruff for linting
- MyPy for type checking
- All code must be type-annotated
- Maximum line length is 100 characters
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Tests should be clear and meaningful
- Use pytest fixtures when appropriate

## Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in the present tense
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add details in the commit body if needed

## Pull Requests

- Reference any related issues
- Include a clear description of changes
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure all checks pass
- Keep changes focused and atomic

## Release Process

Releases are managed through the `release.sh` script:

1. Update the version in `reclaimed/version.py`

2. Run the release script:
   ```bash
   ./release.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Check for required tools (jq)
   - Ensure you're on the main branch
   - Clean previous build artifacts
   - Build the package with UV
   - Create and push git tags
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Update the Homebrew formula with the correct SHA and dependencies
   - Prompt to publish to PyPI

3. To update only the Homebrew formula dependencies:
   ```bash
   ./release.sh --update-deps-only
   ```

4. After running the script, publish to Homebrew:
   - Ensure you have a tap repository at github.com/yourusername/homebrew-tap
   - Copy homebrew/reclaimed.rb to your tap repository
   - Users can then install with: `brew install yourusername/tap/reclaimed`
