**reclaimed** is a cross-platform, ultra-lightweight, and surprisingly powerful command-line tool for analyzing disk usage — with special handling for iCloud storage on macOS.  
Quickly find your largest files and directories with a beautiful, color-coded interface, and manage them through an interactive terminal UI.  
Fully supports **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.

- 📊 **Beautiful UI**: Powered by [Textualize/rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) and [Textualize/textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).
  - Full keyboard navigation, mouse support, and customizable themes.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Terminal UI**: Browse, manage, and delete files/directories with ease.
- 🗑️ **Safe Deletion**: Remove large files and directories directly from the interface — with confirmation prompts.
- 💾 **Export to JSON**: Save scan results for further analysis or batch operations.
